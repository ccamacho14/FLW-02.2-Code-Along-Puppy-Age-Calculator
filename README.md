# FLW 02.2 // Code Along #1 // Doggie Age Calculator

## Code Along #1
We have a calculator to see how old dogs are in human years... but it's not <em>functioning</em> quite yet! 

Let's get started!

1. [ ] Create a function called `calculateDoggieAge` with a parameter called `humanAge`.
</br>

2. [ ] Declare a `doggieAge` variable and set it equal to the `humanAge` multiplied by 7.
</br>

3. [ ] Print the `doggieAge` variable to the `result` div.
   - Put it in string interpolation to have a message that reads "You doggie is _________ years old in human years!"
</br>
</br>

4. [ ] Declare a userInput variable and set it equal to the value of the input. 
   - This needs to be a number, not a string! Be sure to place that inside our Number() method!
</br>
</br>

5. [ ] Call the `calculateDoggieAge` function.
   - Be sure to include the userInput variable as the parameter!
